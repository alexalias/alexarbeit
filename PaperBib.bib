Exact citation: "Duration is obviousely the principal determinaer of tempo at the level under investigation. The principal change occurring in sentences spoken at different tempos is the change in duration occurring in whichever acousticunits we choose to measure. It is clear from the results of production experiments that compression and expansion of the speech signal under fast and slow speaking tempos does not mean a proportional streching and shrinking of the acoustic segments of an utterance (quasiperiodic "vowel" portions, aperiodic portions corresponding roughly to vocal-tract constriction, and the silences corresponding to vocal-tract closure). The relative amount by whhich some acoustic segment changes its duration is also influenced by syllable structure and the foot structure of an utterance among other factors." (p. 5, Introduction)},
